### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- Based on Launch Date, we can conclude that 1) Theater Kickstarter campaigns that launch between May and July are more likely to be successful and 2) Theater Kickstarter campaigns that launch between November and December are more likely to fail.

- Based on Goals, we can conclude that Kickstarter campaigns in the plays subcategory that have a low Goal amount are more likely to be successful than play campaigns with a high goal amount.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
