# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to see how different Kickstarter campaigns in the Theater category fared based on their launch dates and how the subcategory of plays fared based on their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Since only completed outcomes of theater campaigns were of interest, only successful, failed, and canceled outcomes were reviewed while live campaigns were omitted. Overall, there are more successful campaigns than failed or canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis of outcomes based on goals focused on the subcategory of plays that were successful, failed, or canceled. As seen in the graph below, no play campaigns were canceled. When the campaign goal was between $1,500 to $19,999, 50% of play campaigns failed and 50% were successful. Overall, more campaigns were successful when the goal was a lower amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- We can conclude the following based on the theater campaigns' launch dates:
  1. Theater Kickstarter campaigns that launch between May and July are more likely to be successful.
  2. Theater Kickstarter campaigns that launch between November and December are more likely to fail.

- Based on fundraising goals, we can conclude that Kickstarter campaigns in the plays subcategory that have a low Goal amount are more likely to be successful than play campaigns with a high goal amount.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
